							</header>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3><strong>Be Kind and Respectful</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Treat others with kindness, empathy, and respect. This involves actively listening to different perspectives, avoiding offensive language or tone, and refraining from personal attacks. 
								Engage in constructive and positive interactions, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and understood.
							</p>
							<h3><strong>No Bullying or Harassment</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Bullying and harassment are strictly prohibited. Bullying includes any repeated, harmful actions intended to intimidate, humiliate, or harm others. 
								Harassment includes any unwanted, persistent, or offensive behavior that creates an uncomfortable environment for other users. 
								If you witness or experience bullying or harassment, promptly report it for thorough investigation and resolution.
							</p>
							<h3><strong>Maintain Privacy</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Respecting privacy is vital to creating a safe community. 
								Do not share personal information, such as addresses, phone numbers, or financial details, without explicit consent. 
								Exercise caution when sharing your own personal information. If you suspect any breaches of privacy, promptly report them to ensure a swift resolution.
							</p>
							<h3><strong>No Offensive Content</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Ensure that all content, including text, images, videos, and links, adheres to our standards of appropriateness. 
								Offensive content includes but is not limited to hate speech, discriminatory language, violence, sexually explicit material, or any content that may cause discomfort or distress. 
								Help us cultivate a positive and safe environment by reporting any offensive content you encounter.
							</p>
							<h3><strong>Stay on Topic</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Contribute to discussions that align with the purpose and themes of CozyCircles.

							</p>

								Our reporting system is designed to empower the community to maintain a healthy environment.

								We take every report seriously and will conduct a thorough review to ensure appropriate action is taken.
							</p>
							<h3><strong>No Impersonation</strong></h3>
							<p>
								Impersonating other users, public figures, or creating fake accounts undermines the trust within our community.
